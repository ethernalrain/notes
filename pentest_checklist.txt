== Api Pen-Testing checklist ==

* Testing aproach: blackbox / greybox / white box?

* Passive recon
	- conduct attakc surface discovery
	- check for exposed secrets

* Active recon
	- Scan for open ports and services
	- Use application as intended
	- Inspect the web app with dev tools
	- Seearch for API-related directories
	- Discover API endpoints

* Endpoint analysis
	- Find and review API documentation
	- Reverse engineer the API
	- Use the API as intended
	- Analyze the response for:
		- Information disclosuress
		- Excessive data exposures
		- Business logic flaws

* Authentication testing
	- Conduct basic authentication testing
	- Attack and manipulate API tockens

* Conduct Fuzzing
	- FUZZ ALL THE THINGS

* Authorization testing
	- Discover resource identification methods
	- Test for BOLA
	- Test for BFLA

* Mass assingment testing
	- Discover standard parameters used in requests
	- Test for mass assignment

* Injection testing
	- Discover requests that accept user input
	- Test for XSS/XAS
	- Perform database-specific attacks
	- Perform operating system specific attacks (injections)

* Rate limit testing
	- Test fo rexistance of rate limits
	- Test for methods to avoid / bypass rate limits

* Evasion Techniques:
	- Add string terminators to attacks
	- Add case switching to attacks
	- Encode payloads
	- Combine different evasion techniques
	- Rinse and repeat or apply evasive techniques on all previous attacks
