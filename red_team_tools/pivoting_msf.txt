== Pivoting ==

Meang using one compromised system to get deeper into the systems not accessing otherwice.
E.g. using previously accessed / exploited system as pivot points for further deeper pentest.


== Route all metasploit traffic via specific meterpreter session ==

	msf..> route add <dst> <mask> <session>

		^
		|
	This is metasploit, not meterpreter command!

	Ex:

	msf..> router add 192.168.100.0 255.255.255.0 3

And then for example scan via above route:

	msf..> use scanner/portscan/tcp
	msf..> set PORTS 1-1000
	msf..> set RHOSTS 192.168.100.103
	msf..> exploit


NOTE re running exploits via pivot:	reverse_tcp is likely not going to work.
Use bind_tcp payloads instead.


== Socks proxy via pivot ==

	ms> use auxilary/server/socks_proxy
	msf..> show options
	msf..> explit

== Proxychains
	-- tool to run any linux command via proxy:

		/etc/proxychain.conf - change the port, etc.

	# proxychain nmap -Pn -sT -sV ... 

Proxychain redirects all TP connections made by the launched executable to run through 
the proxy.

Note: set version to 4a when running socks_proxy in msf;
